                                    with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\").\nThe

                                    (e.g. Host == \"*\").\nRequests will be matched
                                    against the Host field in the following way:\n1.
                                    If host is precise, the request matches this rule

                                              pathType determines the interpretation of the path matching. PathType can

                                              * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly.
                                              * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
                                                done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
                                                list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
                                                match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
                                                request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
                                                of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
                                                matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
                                              * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
                                                the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
                                                or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
                                              Implementations are required to support all path types.
